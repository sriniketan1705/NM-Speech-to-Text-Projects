 NM-Speech-to-Text-Projects
🗣️ Speech-to-Text Projects Collection
This repository contains three comprehensive projects that explore different aspects of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, developed using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and deep learning frameworks. These projects aim to build, improve, and evaluate Speech-to-Text (STT) systems under various real-world challenges such as background noise, accented speech, and real-time transcription.

📁 Project Structure
🔍 Overview of Projects
🎧 Project 1: Speech-to-Text System with Noise Robustness
Notebook: NM_pr1.ipynb

Goal: Develop a transcription system that performs well even in noisy environments.

Data augmentation with noise

Pretrained models (e.g., Wav2Vec 2.0)

Evaluation with Word Error Rate (WER)

Use Cases:

Accessibility tools

Voice assistants

Meeting transcription

🌍 Project 2: Accent-Aware Speech Recognition System
Notebook: NM4.ipynb

Goal: Improve recognition accuracy across diverse speaker accents using speaker adaptation and data augmentation.

Techniques:

CNNs, RNNs

MLLR (Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression)

Phoneme frequency analysis

Use Cases:

Transcription services

Virtual assistants

Language learning tools

⚡ Project 3: Real-Time STT for Customer Support Automation
Notebook: NM5.ipynb

Goal: Build a low-latency speech-to-text system suitable for customer-agent calls.

Techniques:

HMMs, RNNs

Real-time inference optimization

Sentiment analysis, keyword extraction

Use Cases:

Call summarization

Chatbot integration

Agent performance tracking
