 NM-Speech-to-Text-Projects
🗣️ Speech-to-Text Projects Collection
This repository contains three comprehensive projects that explore different aspects of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, developed using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and deep learning frameworks. These projects aim to build, improve, and evaluate Speech-to-Text (STT) systems under various real-world challenges such as background noise, accented speech, and real-time transcription.

📁 Project Structure
🔍 Overview of Projects
🎧 Project 1: Speech-to-Text System with Noise Robustness
Notebook: NM_pr1.ipynb
Goal: Develop a transcription system that performs well even in noisy environments.
Techniques: Data augmentation with noise, use of pretrained models (e.g., Wav2Vec 2.0), evaluation with Word Error Rate (WER).
Use Cases: Accessibility tools, voice assistants, meeting transcription.
🌍 Project 2: Accent-Aware Speech Recognition System
Notebook: NM4.ipynb
Goal: Improve recognition accuracy across diverse speaker accents using speaker adaptation and data augmentation.
Techniques: CNNs, RNNs, MLLR (Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression), phoneme frequency analysis.
Use Cases: Transcription services, virtual assistants, language learning tools.
⚡ Project 3: Real-Time STT for Customer Support Automation
Notebook: NM5.ipynb
Goal: Build a low-latency speech-to-text system suitable for customer-agent calls.
Techniques: HMMs, RNNs, real-time inference optimization, sentiment analysis, keyword extraction.
Use Cases: Call summarization, chatbot integration, agent performance tracking.
